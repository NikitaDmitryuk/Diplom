@article{Prost2015,
	Abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of cells is largely controlled by a structure that is fundamentally out of thermodynamic equilibrium: a network of crosslinked filaments subjected to the action of energy-transducing molecular motors. The study of this kind of active system was absent from conventional physics and there was a need for both new theories and new experiments. The field that has emerged in recent years to fill this gap is underpinned by a theory that takes into account the transduction of chemical energy on the molecular scale. This formalism has advanced our understanding of living systems, but it has also had an impact on research in physics per se. Here, we describe this developing field, its relevance to biology, the novelty it conveys to other areas of physics and some of the challenges in store for the future of active gel physics.},

@article{Trepat2018,
	Abstract = {We review recent evidence showing that cell and tissue dynamics are governed by mesoscale physical principles. These principles can be understood in terms of simple state diagrams in which control variables include force, density, shape, adhesion and self-propulsion. An appropriate combination of these physical quantities gives rise to emergent phenomena such as cell jamming, topological defects and underdamped waves. Mesoscale physical properties of cell assemblies are found to precede and instruct biological functions such as cell division, extrusion, invasion and gradient sensing. These properties are related to properties of biomolecules, but cannot be predicted from biochemical principles. Thus, biological function is governed by emergent mesoscale states that can be predicted by a simple set of physical properties.},

@article{Doostmohammadi,
	Abstract = {Active matter extracts energy from its surroundings at the single particle level and transforms it into mechanical work. Examples include cytoskeleton biopolymers and bacterial suspensions. Here, we review experimental, theoretical and numerical studies of active nematics - a type of active system that is characterised by self-driven units with elongated shape. We focus primarily on microtubule--kinesin mixtures and the hydrodynamic theories that describe their properties. An important theme is active turbulence and the associated motile topological defects. We discuss ways in which active turbulence may be controlled, a pre-requisite to harvesting energy from active materials, and we consider the appearance, and possible implications, of active nematics and topological defects to cellular systems and biological processes.},

	Abstract = {Homogeneous ice nucleation from supercooled water was studied in the temperature range of 220-240 K through combining the forward flux sampling method (Allen et al.{,} J. Chem. Phys.{,} 2006{,} 124{,} 024102) with molecular dynamics simulations (FFS/MD){,} based on a recently developed coarse-grained water model (mW) (Molinero et al.{,} J. Phys. Chem. B{,} 2009{,} 113{,} 4008). The calculated ice nucleation rates display a strong temperature dependence{,} ranging from 2.148 +/- 0.635 [times] 1025 m-3 s-1 at 220 K to 1.672 +/- 0.970 [times] 10-7 m-3 s-1 at 240 K. These rates can be fitted according to the classical nucleation theory{,} yielding an estimate of the effective ice-water interface energy [gamma]ls of 31.01 +/- 0.21 mJ m-2 for the mW water model. Compared to experiments{,} our calculation underestimates the homogeneous ice nucleation rate by a few orders of magnitude. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. The nucleating ice embryo contains both cubic ice Ic and hexagonal
ice Ih{,} with the fraction of each structure being roughly 50% when the critical size is reached. In particular{,} a novel defect structure containing nearly five-fold twin boundaries is identified in the ice clusters formed during nucleation. The way such defect structure is formed is found to be different from mechanisms proposed for the formation of the same defect in metallic nanoparticles and thin film. The quasi five-fold twin boundary structure found here is expected to occur in the crystallization of a wide range of materials with the diamond cubic structure{,} including ice.},

	Abstract = {The nucleation{,} growth{,} structure and melting of ice in 3 nm diameter hydrophilic nanopores are studied through molecular dynamics simulations with the mW water model. The melting temperature of water in the pore was Tporem = 223 K{,} 51 K lower than the melting point of bulk water in the model and in excellent agreement with experimental determinations for 3 nm silica pores. Liquid and ice coexist in equilibrium at the melting point and down to temperatures as low as 180 K. Liquid water is located at the interface of the pore wall{,} increasing from one monolayer at the freezing temperature{,} Tporef = 195 K{,} to two monolayers a few degrees below Tporem. Crystallization of ice in the pore occurs through homogeneous nucleation. At the freezing temperature{,} the critical nucleus contains [similar]75 to 100 molecules{,} with a radius of gyration similar to the radius of the pore. The critical nuclei contain features of both cubic and hexagonal ice{,} although stacking of hexagonal and cubic
layers is not defined until the nuclei reach [similar]150 molecules. The structure of the confined ice is rich in stacking faults{,} in agreement with the interpretation of X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments. Though the presence of cubic layers is twice as prevalent as hexagonal ones{,} the crystals should not be considered defective Ic as sequences with more than three adjacent cubic (or hexagonal) layers are extremely rare in the confined ice.},

The two most popular alternatives, the fast multipole method (FMM) and the particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) method are compared here to the Ewald method for a single processor machine. Parallel processor implementations of the P3M and Ewald methods are compared. The P3M method is found to be both faster than the FMM and easier to implement efficiently as it relies on commonly available software (FFT subroutines). Both the Ewald and P3M method are easily implemented on parallel architectures with the P3M method the clear choice for large systems.},

	Abstract = {We present a review of the use of molecular dynamics techniques to study the behaviour of proteins. The application of such methods to biological macromolecules has evolved directly from its use to study simpler physical and chemical systems. We describe the methods typically used in producing multiple nanosecond atomic trajectories. This technique is now so common that it is impossible to review the whole area. Therefore, we have focused on three areas, namely the application to proteins of biomedical importance, to folding of proteins from a random conformation to a stable well-defined tertiary structure and to the reverse process, that of unfolding. Finally, we describe some methods which have been developed to analyse complex trajectories with the aim of defining the most important features of protein dynamics and changes in conformation.},

	Abstract = {The constant-pressure, constant-temperature ( NPT ) molecular dynamics approach is re-examined from the viewpoint of deriving a new measure-preserving reversible geometric integrator for the equations of motion. The underlying concepts of non-Hamiltonian phase-space analysis, measure-preserving integrators and the symplectic property for Hamiltonian systems are briefly reviewed. In addition, current measure-preserving schemes for the constant-volume, constant-temperature ensemble are also reviewed. A new geometric integrator for the NPT method is presented, is shown to preserve the correct phase-space volume element and is demonstrated to perform well in realistic examples. Finally, a multiple time-step version of the integrator is presented for treating systems with motion on several time scales.},

	Abstract = {The process of miniemulsification allows the generation of small, homogeneous, and stable droplets containing monomer or polymer precursors and magnetite which are then transferred by polymer reactions to the final polymer latexes, keeping their particular identity without serious exchange kinetics involved. It is shown that the miniemulsion process can excellently be used for the formulation of polymer-coated magnetic nanoparticles which can further be used for biomedical applications. The use of high shear, appropriate surfactants, and the addition of a hydrophobe in order to suppress the influence of Ostwald ripening are key factors for the formation of the small and stable droplets in miniemulsion and will be discussed. Two different approaches based on miniemulsion processes for the encapsulation of magnetite into polymer particles will be presented in detail.},

@article{LI2017217,
	Abstract = {Large-amplitude self-excited thermoacoustic oscillations are unwanted in many premixed propulsion systems, such as rocket motors and gas turbines. However, they are desirable in some other practical applications, such as thermoacoustic prime movers or cooling systems. Thus, predicting the onset of such oscillations and a better understanding of its generation mechanism are important. Previous studies have confirmed that the time delay between unsteady combustion and flow perturbations plays a critical role in generating such thermoacoustic oscillations. In this work, the stability of a 1D thermoacoustic system is investigated theoretically and numerically. A premixed flame is confined in the combustor. The coupling between the unsteady heat release and oncoming flow disturbance is characterized by using interaction index-delay H-τ model. H denotes the interaction index between unsteady combustion and flow. To make the present studies more generalized, acoustic damping ξ is considered. The effects of H and ξ on the stability of the thermoacoustic combustor are investigated. Two interesting stability regions associated with the heating power H and the acoustic damping ξ are found: (a) delay-independent region and (b) stability switches region. When the thermoacoustic system is `locked' in the delay-independent region, it is found that changing the time delay will not affect the stability of the system. However, if the thermoacoustic system is in the stability switches region, then a continuous increase in the time delay can lead to stability switches between stability and instability. Moreover, such switches become more frequent, when H and ξ are coupled and near the boundary between the stability switches region and delay-independent region. The present work opens up an applicable approach to design a stable combustor.},

Although these functions are routinely available from x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering experiments or from computer simulations, they cannot be interpreted unambiguously to provide the spatial order in a molecular liquid. A direct approach to determining the spatial structure in the liquid state is demonstrated here. Three-dimensional maps representing the local atomic densities are presented for several water models. These spatial maps provide a picture of the short-range order in liquid water which reveals specific details of its local structure that are important in the understanding of its properties.},

	Abstract = {Recent models from theoretical physics have predicted that mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, technological advances in experimental and animal tracking techniques have motivated a renewed theoretical interest in animal collective motion and, in particular, locust swarming. This review offers a comprehensive biological background followed by comparative analysis of recent models of locust collective motion, in particular locust marching, their settings, and underlying assumptions. We describe a wide range of recent modeling and simulation approaches, from discrete agent-based models of self-propelled particles to continuous models of integro-differential equations, aimed at describing and analyzing the fascinating phenomenon of locust collective motion. These modeling efforts have a dual role: The first views locusts as a quintessential example of animal collective motion. As such, they aim at abstraction and coarse-graining, often utilizing the tools of statistical physics. The second, which originates from a more biological perspective, views locust swarming as a scientific problem of its own exceptional merit. The main goal should, thus, be the analysis and prediction of natural swarm dynamics. We discuss the properties of swarm dynamics using the tools of statistical physics, as well as the implications for laboratory experiments and natural swarms. Finally, we stress the importance of a combined-interdisciplinary, biological-theoretical effort in successfully confronting the challenges that locusts pose at both the theoretical and practical levels.},

	Abstract = {Author summary Among animal groups, ants hold what may perhaps be the richest repertoire of collective behavior such as trail formation, nest excavation and food dissemination. Of the most intriguing of these behaviors is cooperative food transport, where many ants carry items that individuals cannot move. Using experiments and theory, we study cooperative transport when the motion is frustrated by an obstacle which contains a single narrow opening that leads to the nest. We find that the group exhibits two co-existing modes of motion that allow exploration of possible routes to overcome the obstacle: Either dwelling near the opening and attempting to pass the cargo through, or performing large excursions that can lead to obstacle circumvention. Previous studies have found that co-existing collective dynamic modes emerge when animal groups interact with constraints, however the origin of the phenomena remains unknown. Here, we provide a detailed theoretical explanation of the source of bi-stability and show how stochastic processes drive the transitions between the two dynamical modes.},
